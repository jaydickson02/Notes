<h2 id="aerodynamic-center">Aerodynamic Center</h2>
<p>The aerodynamic center is a point on an airfoil or wing where the pitching moment coefficient does not vary with changes in angle of attack. This means that at the aerodynamic center, the lift and moment generated by the airfoil or wing are relatively constant, regardless of the angle of attack. The location of the aerodynamic center depends on the shape of the airfoil or wing and is an important design parameter for aircraft stability and control.</p>

<h2 id="divergence-speed">Divergence Speed</h2>
<p>The divergence speed of a typical section model is the speed at which the wing structure begins to deform uncontrollably due to aerodynamic loads, and it is an important factor to consider in the design of an aircraft. Increasing the torsional stiffness of the wing structure will increase the divergence speed by making the wing more resistant to torsional deformation. This can be achieved by using stronger materials, increasing the wing thickness, or changing the wing design to incorporate more ribs or other structural elements. Decreasing the wing area may help to decrease the mass of the system, but it will not necessarily increase the divergence speed. Ensuring the elastic axis is sufficiently close to the aerodynamic center is important for stability, but it is not directly related to the divergence speed.</p>

<h2 id="reversal-speed">Reversal Speed</h2>
<p>The reversal speed for an aileron is the airspeed at which the aileron control surface will start to create a negative lift force, which can cause the wing to twist in the opposite direction of the desired roll. The reversal speed is primarily a function of the air density, which decreases with increasing altitude, and is affected by several factors, including the size and shape of the aileron, the wing structure, and the aircraft speed and weight.</p>

<p>As the altitude increases, the air density decreases, which reduces the aerodynamic loads on the wing and aileron, and makes it easier for the aileron to twist in the opposite direction of the desired roll. This means that the reversal speed will increase for increasing altitude. Therefore, it is important to consider the operating altitude when designing an aileron and to ensure that the aileron is designed to withstand the loads that it will experience at the expected operating altitude.</p>

<h2 id="quasi-steady-and-unsteady-aerodynamics">Quasi-steady and Unsteady aerodynamics</h2>
<p>Quasi-steady aerodynamics is an approximation used to simplify the analysis of aerodynamic problems. It assumes that the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on a body are a function of the instantaneous local flow conditions, and that they respond immediately to changes in these conditions, without any lag or memory effect. This means that quasi-steady aerodynamics neglects the effects of unsteady or time-varying flows, such as turbulence, and assumes that the flow remains attached to the body at all times.</p>

<p>In contrast, unsteady aerodynamics models the effects of unsteady or time-varying flows, and takes into account the lag between the motion of the body and the development of the resulting forces and moments. Unsteady aerodynamics can be important for understanding the behavior of aerodynamic systems in turbulent or rapidly changing flows, such as during takeoff or landing, or during maneuvers such as rolls or loops.</p>

<h2 id="divergence-speed-1">Divergence speed</h2>
<p>Divergence speed is the airspeed at which the elastic forces of an aircraft structure cause it to become unstable and undergo uncontrollable deformations. It is an important parameter to consider in aircraft design. The parameters that are important in determining the divergence speed include:</p>

<h2 id="torsional-stiffness">Torsional stiffness</h2>
<p>This refers to the ability of the aircraft structure to resist twisting forces. Increasing torsional stiffness can increase the divergence speed.</p>

<h2 id="lift-curve-slope">Lift curve slope</h2>
<p>This is a measure of how much lift is generated by an aircraft per unit angle of attack. Higher lift curve slopes can increase the divergence speed.</p>

<h2 id="offset-distance-between-shear-and-aerodynamic-center">Offset distance between shear and aerodynamic center</h2>
<p>This parameter is related to the distribution of forces acting on the wing. A smaller offset distance can increase the divergence speed.</p>

<h2 id="profile-drag-coefficient">Profile drag coefficient</h2>
<p>This parameter is a measure of the drag caused by the shape of the airfoil. It is not directly related to the divergence speed.</p>

<p>Modify structure during design process: Structural modifications can be made during the design process to increase the torsional stiffness of the wing or control surface, or to alter the offset distance between the shear and aerodynamic center. This can increase the divergence speed and reduce the risk of control surface reversal.</p>

<p>Use different control surfaces for different flight conditions: Different control surfaces can be used for different flight conditions, such as flaps or spoilers to reduce lift and increase drag during landing. This can help to reduce the loads on the wing and control surfaces and prevent reversal.</p>

<p>Avoid critical flight conditions: Pilots can avoid critical flight conditions, such as high speeds at low altitudes, or high angles of attack, to reduce the risk of control surface reversal. This can be done by adjusting the flight path, reducing airspeed, or altering the aircraft configuration.</p>

<h2 id="flutter">Flutter</h2>

<p>Flutter is an aeroelastic instability that occurs when the elastic forces of an aircraft structure couple with the aerodynamic forces to produce self-excited vibrations. Flutter can lead to catastrophic failure if not addressed properly. The phase relationship between the structural displacements and the aerodynamic forces/moments is an important factor in determining whether flutter will occur.</p>

<p>When the phase relationship between the structural displacements and the aerodynamic forces/moments is 0/180deg, the forces/moments are in phase with the displacements, meaning that they are acting to amplify the motion. This can lead to unstable vibrations and eventually flutter.</p>

<p>In contrast, when the phase relationship between the structural displacements and the aerodynamic forces/moments is 90/270deg, the forces/moments are out of phase with the displacements, meaning that they are acting to dampen the motion. This can lead to stable vibrations that do not lead to flutter.</p>

<h2 id="aeroelasticity">Aeroelasticity</h2>

<p>Aeroelasticity is the study of the interactions between the aerodynamic forces, structural flexibility, and inertial forces that occur in aircraft and other structures subjected to aerodynamic loads. Aeroelastic effects can cause structural vibrations, deformations, and even failures, which can lead to safety issues for aircraft and other structures.</p>

<p>As aircraft designs have become more advanced, with lighter and more flexible structures, aeroelastic effects have become increasingly important. In particular, long, slender wings, such as those used on modern airliners, are particularly susceptible to aeroelastic effects like divergence and flutter. These effects can limit the performance and safety of aircraft if not properly accounted for in the design and operation.</p>

<p>The other options are also partially correct. Modern aircraft do have increasing performance, which can make aeroelastic effects more pronounced. Aeroelasticity is also becoming more multi-disciplinary, with a growing emphasis on control dynamics and other related areas. However, these factors are not as directly related to the importance of aeroelasticity as the susceptibility of modern structures to aeroelastic effects like divergence and flutter. Therefore, the second option is the most correct answer.</p>

<h1 id="cfd">CFD</h1>

<h2 id="what-is-cfd">What is CFD?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Computational fluid dynamics</li>
  <li>How to define it.
    <ul>
      <li>Simulating fluid flow, heat transfer, mass transfer, and related phenomena by solving governing equations numnerically.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Technically even a computer solution of potential flow is CFD although we usually reserve the term for more complex Navier-Stokes based simulations.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-is-it-useful">Why is it useful?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Avoids experimental costs and issues</li>
  <li>Unfortuantly the full Navier-Stokes equations cant be solved so we need to model and validate it with real-life testing at some point in the design cycle.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-are-the-steps-in-performing-cfd">What are the steps in performing CFD?</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Choose the mathematical model</li>
  <li>Make an other simplifying assumptions</li>
  <li>Define the region of fluid you want to simulate</li>
  <li>Mesh (discretize) the fluid region</li>
  <li>Define the fluid properties</li>
  <li>Run the solver</li>
  <li>Examine the results</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="naiver-stokes-equations">Naiver Stokes Equations</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Most complete mathematical model describing the flow of a fluid.
    <h3 id="typical-version-of-the-equation">Typical version of the equation:</h3>
    <p>\(\nabla \cdot u = 0 \quad \textrm{Conservation of Mass}\)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

\[\rho {du \over dt} = {- \nabla p + \mu \nabla ^2 u + F} \quad \textrm{Newtons Second Law}\]

<h3 id="continuity-equation">Continuity equation</h3>

\[{\partial p \over \partial t} + {\partial (pu) \over \partial x} + {\partial(pv) \over \partial y} + {\partial (pw) \over \partial z} = 0\]

<ul>
  <li>Rate of change of mass within a control volume is equal to the sum of the $\dot m$ flow in - $\dot m$ flow out</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="derivation">Derivation</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Mass of fluid in the control volume, density time volume:
\(\rho \cdot dx \cdot dy \cdot dz\)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where: dx, dy, dz are the sides of the control volume.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rate of change of the mass is:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

\[\partial (\rho \cdot dx \cdot dy \cdot dz) \over \partial t\]

<ul>
  <li>Of course dx, dy, dz are not changing with time, so:</li>
</ul>

\[{\partial \rho \over \partial t} dx \cdot dy \cdot dz\]

<ul>
  <li>Now we consider the flow in and out of the control volume. At every point in the control volume the fluid will have a velocity vector. Denoted:</li>
</ul>

\[\vec V = ui + vj + wk\]

<ul>
  <li>Consider the opposite sides of the cube, only the flow in that direction will move fluid across the boundary, the other flow vectors are tangental. So for the horizontal direction the only component of importance for flow rate is u. So the volume flow rate is:</li>
</ul>

\[u \cdot dy \cdot dz\]

<ul>
  <li>To turn that into a mass flow rate we multiply by the density.</li>
</ul>

\[\rho \cdot u \cdot dy \cdot dz\]

<ul>
  <li>Now we turn this into a net mass flow equation, so mass flow in minus mass flow out.</li>
</ul>

\[\rho \cdot u \cdot dy \cdot dz - \rho (u + {du \over dx} dy \cdot dz)\]

<ul>
  <li>Expanding gives:</li>
</ul>

\[\rho u \cdot dy \cdot dz - \rho u \cdot dy \cdot dz - \rho {du \over dx} \cdot dx \cdot dy \cdot dz\]

<ul>
  <li>Canceling the front terms leaves us with:</li>
</ul>

\[- \rho {du \over dx} \cdot dx \cdot dy \cdot dz\]

<ul>
  <li>This is the net mass flow rate into the box through the two horizontal sides. Considering this for all the other sides:</li>
</ul>

\[- \rho {dv \over dy} \cdot dx \cdot dy \cdot dz\]

\[- \rho {dw \over dz} \cdot dx \cdot dy \cdot dz\]

<ul>
  <li>We substitute these into the orignial stated equation, $\dot m = \dot m_{in} - \dot m_{out}$</li>
</ul>

\[{\partial \rho \over \partial t} dx \cdot dy \cdot dz =   - \rho {du \over dx} \cdot dx \cdot dy \cdot dz - \rho {dv \over dy} \cdot dx \cdot dy \cdot dz  - \rho {dw \over dz} \cdot dx \cdot dy \cdot dz\]

<ul>
  <li>Divide by $ dx \cdot dy \cdot dz$:</li>
</ul>

\[{\partial \rho \over \partial t} + \rho ({du \over dx} +  {dv \over dy} +  {dw \over dz})  =  0\]

<ul>
  <li>So term one is the mass flow, term two is the net flow in the x direction, term two is the net flow in the y direction and term 3 is the net flow in the z direction. We know all these need to sum to 0 because the need to balance for mass conservation.</li>
  <li>This assumes incompressability so constant density $\rho$, the equation as first stated above considered compressible flow effects.</li>
</ul>
