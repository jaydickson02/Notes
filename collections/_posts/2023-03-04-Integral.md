# Integral

These are some examples:
$$
\int{x^2} = 2x
$$

$$
x^2 \over y
$$

---

# Derivative

$\dot x^2 = 2x$



---

# For Loop to Find Odd and Even Numbers

## Code Bellow

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++){
  if(i % 2 = 0){
  console.log("even");
  } else {
  console.log("odd")
  }
}
```

##  Quadratic Formula

---

The quadratic formula is as follows:
$$
x = {{-b +- \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}} \over 2a}
$$

* The x represents the soloutions on the x-intecepts the other variables are from the definition of a quadratic equation. Give bellow:
  $$
  ax^2 + bx + c
  $$

``` sql
insert * into 
```
