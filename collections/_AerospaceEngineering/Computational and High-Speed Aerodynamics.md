# Lecture 1 - Review of Aerodynamic Concepts

## Physical Quantities

* Every physical quantity can be expressed in terms of 4 fundamental properties
	* Mass (m)
	* Length (L)
	* Time (t)
	* Temperature (T)
	

## Properties of a Fluid
* Density
* Viscosity
	* No-Slip Condition
	* Gives rise to most important aerodynamic concepts
* Pressure
	* Normal force

## Dimensional Analysis
* We often have to rely on experiments to determine the answers
* We use dimensional analysis to reduce the number of variables we need to experimentally consider.
