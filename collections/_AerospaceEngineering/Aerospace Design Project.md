# The Design Process

- Starts with a customer need
    - Request for proposal (RFP)
    - Brief
- Define the requirments
    - This is a two way process between the designer and the customer
    - Allows for a generation of a product requirments document (PRD)
        - Making the product to this ensures you have met your legal needs
- Generate Ideas
- Evaluate the ideas
    - Core of engineering
- Decide
- Restart the loop from idea generation
    -   This could be done twice
    -   Allows us to make sure we have the best solution
- Final design definition
    - End with a complient product
